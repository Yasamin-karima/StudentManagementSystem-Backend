-> for "term" & "course" , availability will be set to true
    just in initializing in constructor.
    setting it to false should be handled manually.

-> for "assignment", availability is set to true when
    adding an assignment by teacher,
    but i dont know when to unavailable it exactly,
    maybe after deadline???
